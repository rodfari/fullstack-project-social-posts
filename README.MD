# Rodrigo de Farias

To run this project, you need to have PostgreSQL, .NET Core 8, and Node.js installed on your machine.

First, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Backend/Infrastructure/Persistence/pgSQL
```

Then, run the migration command to add the migration from within the database folder:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add Initial --startup-project ../../../Consumer/Api
```

Next, update the database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update Initial --startup-project ../../../Consumer/Api
```

After that, you can run the project using `dotnet run` and start the frontend. You're good to go!

## Self Critique

If I had more time, I would focus on adding more comprehensive tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the project. Additionally, I would refactor some parts of the code to enhance readability.

Regarding scaling, the parts that would likely fail first are the database and the API endpoints. As the number of users and posts increases, the database might become a bottleneck due to the increased load, and the API endpoints might struggle to handle the high number of requests.

To scale this product, I would take the following steps:

1. **Database Optimization**: caching, and sharding to improve performance and handle a larger volume of data.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and quickly address any issues that arise.

By taking these steps, the project would be better equipped to handle growth and provide a reliable experience for a large number of users.
